# Predicting Customer Churn in a Telecommunication Company

### Context:
Customer churn, known as churn rate, which is a indicator that measure the evasion rate of customers, that is, the rate of cancellation of a given service. Based on this information, it is possible to create a machine learning model that predicts which customers have the potential probability to terminate the business relationship with the company and somehow create tasks to retain those customers.

Your job is to find potential customers who are likely to leave the company and direct the sales team to them, making it possible to launch promotions and keep customers for the following year.

At the end of the project, the CEO needs the following questions answered:

What is the Operator Churn Rate today?
How does the model perform when classifying customers in Churn?
